# Example
This is an example of how to use the Stackberry iOS SDK. Check out the Stackberry Guide (link to be posted) and walk along with this starter project.

## Getting Started

The pods are not checked in to the repository, so after you clone you'll need to run: 
```
pod install
```
in the root directory. This app needs to connect to a Stackberry Backend to work properly, so you'll need to fill in your **App Key** and **App Secret** in the initialization method in the App Delegate as well as in the Build Phase Run Script.

## Issues and Feedback

If you run into any issues or have feedback, feel free to file them here or contact us on Slack ([slack.stackberry.io](https://slack.stackberry.io)
